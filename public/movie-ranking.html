<h3>Shutter Island by Leonardo DiCaprio</h3>
<p>Amazing story which always have you wondering about the plot twist,
  I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who's reading, but this is number 1
  on my list for sure. Give it a watch!!

<h3>The Legend of Hercules</h3>
<P>The fact this movie is based on old greek methology is the reason
  I picked the movie in the first place with Liam McIntyre being one of my
  favourite actors in his gladiator series and movies, I decided to give
  this a try and I am so glad I did. Absolutely brilliant movie!!

<h3>300</h3>
<P>This movie was based back in 480BC ancient greece times, When sparta wher
  fighting the Persians, But what hooked me was the gore and fighting that happens
through-out the movie which always kept me on my toes. </P>
